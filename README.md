IHMS (Intelligent Health Monitoring System)

System Overview

IHMS is an IoT-based health monitoring system designed to aid in the ongoing public health crisis brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. The system monitors vital signs such as heart rate, body temperature, oxygen levels, and movement of a person. These parameters are key indicators of a person's health and can be used to detect the early onset of many illnesses, including COVID-19.
Features

    Real-time monitoring of pulse rate, body temperature, and oxygen levels
    Instant alert notification system using a buzzer/speaker
    Remote patient monitoring with data sent to the Cloud
    Can be used by medical professionals to monitor patients remotely, improving healthcare accessibility

Hardware Components

    Arduino UNO
    Pulse Oximeter – MAX30100/MAX30102
    Temperature sensor
    Buzzer
    ESP8266 WIFI Module

Software Prerequisites

    Arduino IDE
    Any MQTT Client (for example, MQTTX)
    Any Cloud Platform supporting MQTT protocol
